# Overview
This project follows the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) in the [JavaScript Basics tutorial](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) of the foundation course provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

# Problem
A game where a user is able to play rock paper scissors against a computer. The computer will randomly choose from the three options, 'Rock' 'Paper' or 'Scissors'. Likewise, the user has the option to choose from these choices, but unlike the computer has the free will to choose their "weapon".

The game will be comprised of a max of 5 win/loss rounds where the first to three is the game winner. After each round, a message is displayed to the user indicating if they won, lost, or tied. 

There will be a display to the user to pick from their three options, and once clicked the results will immediately be displayed. On a third win or third loss, the game will finish. The user will be able to see their score as the game is ongoing.
